Imagine a graph with nodes A, B, C, D, and E, where A connects to B and C, B connects to D, and C connects to E.\n\nStarting at A, BFS would visit the nodes in this order: A → B → C → D → E.\n\nHere's the queue evolution:\n1. Queue: [A]\n2. Visit A → Enqueue B, C → Queue: [B, C]\n3. Visit B → Enqueue D → Queue: [C, D]\n4. Visit C → Enqueue E → Queue: [D, E]\n5. Visit D → Queue: [E]\n6. Visit E → Done"
